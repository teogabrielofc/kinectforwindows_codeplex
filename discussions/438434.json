I don't need  <strong>grisp\\press\\scroll</strong> events,all i need is information like <strong>handOver\\handLeave</strong> some uieleement. In such case depth stream initialization is unnecessary ,right?<br />\nAnd as i read in <strong>human interface guidlines v 1.5</strong> that implementation of <strong>physical interaction zone(phiz)</strong> is quiet complex,that's why the question is like can we get  phiz out of box without depth stream init))<br />\n i maked my simple implementation like follow<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n <span style=\"color:Green;\">//all params in meters,it&#39;s set up size and offset from hipCenter,</span>\n <span style=\"color:Green;\">//height of phiz based on distination from hipcenter to shoulder center</span>\n <span style=\"color:Green;\">//in skeleton space it like flat rectangle</span>\n <span style=\"color:Blue;\">var</span> pizInfo=<span style=\"color:Blue;\">new</span> PIZInfo(hipOffsetX,hipOffsetY,Width,someAddingToHeight);\n\n<span style=\"color:Green;\">//usage</span>\n<span style=\"color:Green;\">//update every frame for player skeleton</span>\npizInfo.update(userSkeleton);\n...\n<span style=\"color:Green;\">//every frame update pizinfo mapped to depthspace</span>\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">var</span> rect=pizinfo.getRectangleInDepthSpace(coordinateMapper);\n\n<span style=\"color:Green;\">// and then get hand in depth space and map hand position relate to pizInDepthSpace local coordinate system</span>\n...\n\r\n</pre></div>",
