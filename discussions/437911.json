It should be easy, I guess, just set up the following values to true:            \n<br />\n<pre><code> this.chooser.NearMode = true;\n this.chooser.SeatedMode = true;</code></pre>\n\nHowever, the application freezes when skeletal tracking initializes. After about 15 seconds, I see an avatar, but then it freezes back again.<br />\n<br />\nI'm using Windows 7, x64, visual studio 2010 run in administrator mode.<br />\n",

Please let us know, if this does not fix the issue.\n</code></pre>\n\nYou can also just press 'n' in the demo to toggle between standard and having near mode and seated mode switched on.<br />\n",
